  net/sched: Retire tcindex classifier



net/sched: Retire tcindex classifier

jira: ROC-3197
cve: CVE-2023-1829
commit: 8c710f75256bb3cf05ac7b1672c82b92c43f3d28
upstream-diff: In our kernel code we had deleted include/net/tc_wrapper.h but this patch adds it back in which we ignore. It also removes net/sched/cls_tcindex.c.

The tcindex classifier has served us well for about a quarter of a century
but has not been getting much TLC due to lack of known users. Most recently
it has become easy prey to syzkaller. For this reason, we are retiring it.
