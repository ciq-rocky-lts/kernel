smb: client: fix OOB in receive_encrypted_standard()

jira SECO-47
cve CVE-2024-0565
commit eec04ea119691e65227a97ce53c0da6b9b74b0b7
upstream-diff no diff for the file content but the file location
has changed from fs/cifs/ to fs/smb/client/

Fix potential OOB in receive_encrypted_standard() if server returned a
large shdr->NextCommand that would end up writing off the end of
@next_buffer.

handle compounded responses")
